# ThinkNext: AI Olympiad Project

**ThinkNext** is a high-fidelity prototype of an AI-powered educational platform, created for the AI Olympiad competition. This project demonstrates a modern, interactive learning environment designed to enhance the educational experience for both students and teachers through intelligent feedback, personalized learning, and tools for academic integrity.

The core of the platform is a dual-dashboard system: one for teachers to create and manage content, and one for students to learn and engage.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dual Dashboards:** Separate, intuitive interfaces for:
    * **Students:** To view upcoming homework, track their gamified progress (points, rank, badges), and access their learning materials.
    * **Teachers:** To create assignments, monitor submissions, and analyze class performance.

* **AI-Powered Assignment Creation:** Teachers can create assignments with settings for AI Grading, AI Feedback, and student monitoring.

* **Intelligent Grading & Analysis:** The platform provides an "AI Score" for submissions and generates an "AI Analysis Summary" for the teacher. This summary identifies common student misunderstandings and visualizes the class's score distribution.

* **Contextual AI Chat Assistant:** Students can chat with an AI tutor. The AI's knowledge is scoped to specific lecture transcripts or uploaded study materials, ensuring it provides relevant, accurate help based on course content.

* **Student Focus Mode:** A distraction-free environment for students when completing assignments. This mode includes a timer, a word count tracker, and simulates "Focus Mode" (screen lock) capabilities to ensure academic integrity.

* **Gamified Student Dashboard:** The student dashboard encourages engagement by showing progress through points, a class rank, and earned badges.
