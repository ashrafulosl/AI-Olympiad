                            <p>The long-term consequences of the Treaty of Versailles were profound and far-reaching, arguably setting the stage for future global conflict. Signed in 1919, the treaty officially ended World War I but imposed harsh terms on Germany, including the controversial War Guilt Clause (Article 231), significant territorial losses, severe military restrictions, and crippling reparations payments.</p>
                            <p>Economically, the reparations demanded were astronomical, contributing heavily to the hyperinflation experienced by the Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. This economic instability fostered widespread resentment among the German population and weakened the legitimacy of the new democratic government. While France sought security through these measures, the economic hardship ultimately fueled political extremism.</p>
                             <p>Politically, the treaty redrew the map of Europe, creating new nations but also sowing seeds of future disputes. The principle of self-determination was applied inconsistently, leaving significant German-speaking minorities in newly formed countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland. This became a major point of contention exploited later by nationalist movements.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the failure of the League of Nations, an institution conceived alongside the treaty to maintain peace, proved critical. The US Senate's refusal to ratify the treaty and join the League significantly undermined its authority from the start. The League's inability to effectively address aggression in the 1930s, such as the Japanese invasion of Manchuria or Italian actions in Ethiopia, demonstrated its weakness.</p>
                             <p>The perceived injustice and humiliation of the treaty, particularly the War Guilt Clause and reparations, became a powerful rallying cry for nationalist and extremist groups in Germany, most notably the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler. They promised to overturn the treaty's terms and restore Germany's national pride. While the Treaty of Versailles alone did not cause World War II, its harsh terms and the subsequent political and economic environment it created were significant contributing factors to the rise of fascism and the path to another global conflict. There was also a mention of the Treaty of Tordesillas which seems out of place here, perhaps confusing it with another post-WWI treaty like Saint-Germain.</p>
                             <p>In conclusion, the Treaty of Versailles, intended to secure a lasting peace, paradoxically contributed to the instability that led to World War II through its punitive economic demands, territorial rearrangements that ignored ethnic realities, and the weakening of international cooperation mechanisms.</p>

                                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 pl-4 border-l-4 border-blue-300">
                                    <strong>AI Assessment:</strong> This essay presents a generally well-organized argument addressing the core prompt. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the main historical events. The central thesis regarding the long-term consequences of the Treaty of Versailles is identifiable and mostly sustained throughout the paper.<br>
                                    <strong>Thesis Clarity:</strong> Explicitly stated in the introduction. Could be slightly more nuanced to encompass both political and economic impacts from the outset.

                                    <strong>Strengths:</strong> Paragraphs generally follow a logical sequence, moving from immediate post-war effects to longer-term repercussions. Topic sentences are mostly effective in signaling the focus of each paragraph.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Opportunities:</strong> The connection between the discussion of the League of Nations' failures (paragraph 4) and the rise of German nationalism (paragraph 5) could be more explicitly articulated with a stronger transition sentence. The conclusion effectively summarizes but could more powerfully restate the refined thesis.

                                     <strong>Potential Inaccuracies/Confusions:</strong> Minor point: The essay briefly mentions the Treaty of Tordesillas in a context where the Treaty of Saint-Germain might be more relevant, suggesting a possible minor confusion between historical treaties.
